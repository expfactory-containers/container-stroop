![https://expfactory.github.io/expfactory/img/expfactoryticketyellow.png](https://expfactory.github.io/expfactory/img/expfactoryticketyellow.png)

This is an automated build to generate a stroop task container, including the following Expfactory experiments:

 - [stroop](https://www.github.com/expfactory-experiments/stroop)
 - [stroop-5min](https://www.github.com/expfactory-experiments/stroop-5min)

It is intended for [this study](https://osf.io/9pc46/) registered on OSF. 
It is generated by way of the [expfactory builder](https://expfactory.github.io/builder) by writing the names of these
library experiments into the [experiments.txt](experiments.txt) file here, and then being built and deployed to Docker
Hub via this circle CI workflow:

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/expfactory-containers/container-stroop.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/expfactory-containers/container-stroop)


## Usage
You can run the container as follows: 

```
docker run -d -p 80:80 vanessa/expfactory-container-stroop start
```

and you will see the familiar interface to choose your task and get started. [There are many ways to deploy](https://expfactory.github.io/expfactory/usage). depending on your needs for a database and experiment selection. Please reach out by asking a question on the issue board if you need help.
