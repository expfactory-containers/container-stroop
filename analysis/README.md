### Run the Container

As an example, the container was run to deploy the two tasks, and save data to a local folder on
the filesystem at `/tmp/data`:


```bash
$ docker run -p 80:80 -v /tmp/data:/scif/data vanessa/expfactory-container-stroop start
...
Database set as filesystem
Starting Web Server

 * Starting nginx nginx
   ...done.

```

For the above, the container is pulled from Docker Hub, named `vanessa/expfactory-container-stroop`.
We did not designate a tag, and by default pulled latest. If you want to find a tag corresponding
with a particular Github commit id, [view the tags here](https://hub.docker.com/r/vanessa/expfactory-container-stroop/tags/) and rnu (or pull) as follows:

```bash
$ docker pull vanessa/expfactory-container-stroop:<tag>
$ docker run -p 80:80 -v /tmp/data:/scif/data vanessa/expfactory-container-stroop:<tag> start
```

### Data
The data saved in `/tmp/data` with default study id `expfactory` and a randomly generated id was then copied into 
this folder.

```bash
# ensure we have permissions to touch the data
$ sudo chown -R /tmp/data $USER

# move it here
mkdir expfactory
$ mv /tmp/data/expfactory expfactory
```

The analysis script [5min_stroop_analyses.R](5min_stroop_analyses.R) was then run to produce the result. Note
that this analysis itself is not fully reproducible, as you would need to install R and the required packages.
